        <h1>Who is Pat?</h1>
          <p class="tagLines">He's helpful, athletic, driven and perhaps a little too restless. But what'd you expect from somebody with his position.
            <br><br>
            He was born in an average family in an average port. He lived without worry until he was about 12 years old, but at that point things changed.
            <br><br>
            He studied a lot and was learning how to cook in new styles. Alongside trusted friends, he managed to thrive in a weird world. But with his honesty and skills, there's nothing to stop him from improving the world. He could quickly become an unstoppable force.
            <br><br>
            Despite all this success, he is currently still looking for a true calling. He feels like there's more than what we get to know in this world. Luckily he has plenty of resources to support him..
